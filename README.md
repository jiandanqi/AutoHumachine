## Future Expansions

### Data management module: 
Distributed data storage technology is adopted to achieve a data management system with high availability, high scalability, and high performance. At the same time, the data provider is designed to provide data query, storage, and management functions. Consider data privacy and security, and adopt technologies such as data encryption and access control to ensure the security and reliability of data.

### Security module: 
Implement comprehensive security strategies, including software security, hardware security, network security, and data security. Adopt technologies such as security hardening, vulnerability scanning, and security monitoring to ensure the security and stability of the system. At the same time, safety drills and emergency response are carried out to improve the response and resilience of the system.

### Human-machine co-driving control module: 
Design flexible co-driving strategies, including functions such as automatic driving weight adjustment, takeover mode, and co-driving mode switching. Consider the needs of different scenarios and different users to provide a personalized ride-sharing experience. At the same time, intelligent decision-making technology is adopted to realize adaptive co-driving control and improve the driving performance and safety of the system.

### Human-computer interaction module: 
Design a human-computer interaction interface to ensure user-friendliness, ease of use and scalability. At the same time, various interaction methods such as voice interaction, gesture recognition, and touch screen are considered to improve the user's experience. Human-computer interaction data analysis technology can also be used to achieve a personalized user experience.
